# When-Was-the-Golden-Age-of-Video-Games-

This repository contains the final project for the Data Analyst in SQL track on DataCamp. The project focuses on analyzing the top 400 best-selling video games created between 1977 and 2020 to determine whether video games have improved as the gaming market has grown.

**Project Overview**

Video games have become a booming industry, with the global gaming market projected to surpass $300 billion by 2027. Major game publishers strive to create successful games that capture the market's attention and generate substantial revenue. This project aims to investigate whether games have indeed improved over time or if the golden age of video games has already passed.

**Dataset**

The project utilizes a dataset containing information on game sales, critic reviews, and user reviews. The dataset includes two tables, each limited to 400 rows for the purposes of this project. However, the complete dataset, encompassing over 13,000 games, can be found on Kaggle.
